Graf - a customizable graphing/charting Javascript library
----------------------------------------------------------

Graf is a small client-side graphing/charting Javascript library that gives you control over all elements, 
including the ability to add custom interactions, using your own preferred Javascript library. 
It relies upon RaphaÃ«l, an awesome small Javascript library for putting interactive vector graphics on your page.

NOTE: The API is still undergoing heavy refactoring; this is still in an early prototype stage.
